## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate **Data Engineer** with over 3 years of experience building robust data pipelines, optimizing ETL workflows, and delivering real-time analytics solutions. I love transforming messy raw data into elegant, actionable insights.

Currently wrapping up my Master’s in Data Science, I’ve led projects across education, sustainability, sports analytics, and social media NLP. Whether it's building AI-enabled platforms or solving scheduling problems with constraint programming, I enjoy working at the intersection of **data, software, and optimization**.

🌟 **Actively seeking full-time roles** in Data Engineering, Analytics Engineering, or Cloud Data Solutions!
